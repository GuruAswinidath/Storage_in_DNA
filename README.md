# Storage_in_DNA
## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of how to store data in DNA. Storing information in DNA molecules offers the potential for high-density, long-term data storage due to DNA's exceptional information storage capacity and longevity.

## Getting Started

To get started with DNA data storage, follow the steps below:

- Encode the data: Convert the data you want to store into a binary format. You can use existing encoding schemes or develop your own based on your specific requirements.

- Map binary codes to DNA nucleotides: Create a mapping scheme that associates each binary code with a specific DNA nucleotide sequence. This mapping allows you to represent binary digits as DNA sequences.

- Divide the binary data into chunks: Split the binary data into smaller chunks. It's common to divide the data into sequences of fixed length (e.g., 100 bits per DNA fragment).

- Convert binary to DNA: Convert each binary chunk into its corresponding DNA sequence using the mapping scheme created earlier. Replace each binary digit with the corresponding nucleotide sequence.

- Synthesize the DNA: Once you have the DNA sequences representing your data, you need to synthesize the actual DNA molecules. This process involves laboratory techniques such as DNA synthesis or DNA printing.

- Store and retrieve the DNA: Store the synthesized DNA molecules in a suitable medium, such as test tubes or DNA microarrays. Use proper storage conditions to ensure the stability and longevity of the DNA. When needed, retrieve the stored DNA by applying appropriate laboratory techniques.

- Data retrieval and decoding: Develop algorithms and methods to retrieve and decode the stored DNA data back into its original binary or text format. Reverse the encoding and mapping steps to extract the original data from the DNA sequences.
